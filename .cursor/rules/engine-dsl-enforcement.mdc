# Engine Rules

## Constraints

- No hardcode: data from `context` (@ui8kit/data) or props only
- DSL only: use `<If>`, `<Loop>`, `<Var>` from @ui8kit/template (no `.map`, `?:`, `&&` in JSX)
- ui8kit semantics: semantic props, no `className`/`style`/raw HTML
- Comments in English

## Mandatory checklist (before final answer)

1. `bun run lint` (from apps/engine)
2. `bun run lint:dsl` (from apps/engine)
3. If templates changed: `bun run generate` + `bun run scripts/copy-templates-to-dev.ts`

Report pass/fail. If skipped, state why.
